Exploiting different standard temporal structures seen in time series processes

## ARIMA vs Exponential Smoothing

- Exponential Smoothing is very specific(Linear trend, Seasonality)

- ARIMA imposes no such structure
- It is more "machine learning"-like (where you take a model and try to fit it to your data, whatever structure your data may have)




## Key Features
## 1. **Auto Regressive (AR)**:
- Regression of a time series process onto itself (its past versions)
- A time series process is AR if its present value depends on a linear combination of past observations.
- In financial time series, an AR model attempts to explain the mean reversion and trending behaviours that we observe in asset prices.
